Back in September in went on a extended weekend adventure to Norway with one of my god friends Henrik. Henrik had just got his brand new BMW 1200GS Adventure and we had to test it out.

The trip was from Copenhagen to Norway, though Sweden and return to Copenhagen with the ferry from Oslo. Henrik did a fantastic job planning the routes and my recollection for the precise route we ended up taking is bad, but boy was it beautiful! The roads were fantastic and the nature was great. We planed to camp each night, but often I was too easy just to rent a hut.

One of the big learning’s from this trip is the ease of renting a hut vs. the amount of gear you need to bring for camping. For a extended weekend its way easier to just rent places on the way. If you wish to camp, you need to go more minimalistic then we did. I am thinking of buying a small one man tent and make sure that my camp is fast to set up.

It turned out to be a part of a big house located next to it and out from the house came a man with a big smile, no angry words about the two big bikes on his nice lawn. We talked for two minutes and he invited us to stay in their small cabin at the end of the lawn. People are so nice when you arrive on a bike! This image is from the next day."}) %>

It was a fantastic trip, and certainly easier to relax as I get more experienced. There are still work to be done on my bike and gear before the setup is perfect. I need better tiers (I knew that), better foot pegs and bar risers plus crashbars. In the dark I am missing some more light.

Good preparation as Henrik did is also fantastic, that really added value to the trip, but tips from the locals also showed us some fantastic roads. Henrik spotted some good off-road routes from mountain bike trails and I think we are going to ride more off-road next time, right Henrik? ;)

Thanks to Henrik for a fantastic trip!
