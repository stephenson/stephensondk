I read a lot about other people’s adventures around the world on motorcycles. I love reading ride reports and stories from the road. 

Lately I have bean reading stories from unknown writers how have bean on trips that I wish to experience one day!

## Ride to the Midnight Sun
– A Motorcycle Adventure in two weeks and one day

The novel is a quick read about Stephen Mason’s trip from his home in Scotland to North Cape, Norway. He travels alone and completes the entire trip in 2 weeks and one day. 
The story is inspiring and funny; it makes you want to go on an adventure right away!

## Gone riding
[Dom Giles](http://domgiles.co.uk/) is a funny and great story teller who dream about traveling the world on a motorcycle, when his wife push him to do it he takes it to the extreme. First leg of the trip is from Alaska to Panama and second part is from South Africa going north through nine countries.

I am not done with the book yet, but Dom’s writing style, size of the adventure and his history knowledge is already making it a great read.
