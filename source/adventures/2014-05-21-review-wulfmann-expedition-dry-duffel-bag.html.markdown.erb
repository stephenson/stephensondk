One of my big dreams about motorcycles is the dream about adventure traveling. I have seen [Ewan and Charlie](http://longwayround.com/) travel the world, I have [read books](http://www.stephenson.dk/adventures/2014/two-great-reads-on-motorcycle-adventures) and I have used the entire winter to dream about the upcoming adventures. 

In late April I left on my first mini adventure, three days in Sweden with my tent, my kindle and the wild life. I needed something to carry my gear and the money was not there to buy a full pannier set just yet. 

On my search I tumbled over a new Danish web-shop selling [Wulfmann gear](http://www.allroadadventures.dk/collections/oppakning), especially the Expedition Dry Duffel bag (size large) caught my attention. The price was fair and the next day it arrived to my office.

The quality of the bag was way beyond my expectations. The material is solid, the stitching is quality work and the design is great.
Fitting it on my BMW G650GS Sertao was easy; just wrap the strap around the handles on the back of the bike and tighten them, done!

I bought the large version of the bag to be sure all my gear for a weekend could fit in it, not a problem! I had my tent, sleeping bag, carpet pad, cloth, cooking equipment etc. in the bag. With all that gear in the bag it was quit heavy, and mounting it on the high back of my BMW made it a bit top-heavy, but not a big problem. 

The Wulfmann Expedition Dry Duffel bag performed perfectly on the trip and I don’t think you can get anything in such a good quality to a competing price. 

The only real negative thing I have to say is that I don’t trust the included straps to mount the bag to the bike, I quickly upgraded to ROK straps. 

The bag gets my warmest recommendations!
