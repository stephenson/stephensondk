After my father passed away I have dreamed about reviving our adventure trips in kayaks to Sweden and Norway, but in the same time I knew that kayaking was not my favorite way of traveling.  I fell in love with adventure bikes and combining on-road with off-road and camping was the perfect match for me.

I bought my BMW G650GS Sertao in October last year and the last six months have ben too cold to go on multi day trips, but last week the weather looked to be okay and I was off to Sweden for three days on my first trip!
