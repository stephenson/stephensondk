One of my big motorcycle fantasies involves adventure traveling. I have watched [Ewan and Charlie](http://longwayround.com/)  travel the world, I have [read books](http://www.stephenson.dk/adventures/2014/two-great-reads-on-motorcycle-adventures) and I have spent the entire winter dreaming about my upcoming adventures.

In late April I left on my first mini adventure; three days in Sweden with my tent, my kindle and the wildlife. I needed something in which to carry my gear, and my funds didn’t quite stretch to a full pannier set. 

During my search for alternatives I stumbled upon a new Danish website selling [Wolfman gear](http://www.allroadadventures.dk/collections/oppakning), and the Expedition Dry Duffel bag (size large) particularly caught my attention. The price was fair and the next day it arrived in my office.

The quality of the bag was way beyond my expectations: solid material, good quality stitching and great design.

Fitting it on my BMW G650GS Sertao was easy; just wrap the strap around the handles on the back of the bike and tighten: done!

With all my gear for a weekend in mind, I bought the large version of the bag. Not a problem! My tent, sleeping bag, carpet pad, cloth, cooking equipment, etc. all fitted in the bag. All that gear made the bag quite hefty, and mounting it on the high back of my BMW made it a bit top-heavy, but it wasn’t a big problem.

The Wolfman Expedition Dry Duffel bag performed perfectly on the trip, and I don’t think there is anything of such good quality available in the price range. The straps for mounting the bag to a bike are the only real negatives: I didn’t trust them and quickly upgraded to [ROK straps](http://www.rokstraps.com/). 

The bag gets my warmest recommendations!
